================

PerformanceVisor (PVSR) is a commercially available monitoring solution from NETvisor Ltd. It is a unified platform for monitoring not just networks but also service quality and end-user experience, applications and various components of IT infrastructures. 

As part of the mPlane project NETvisor Ltd. developed an universal mPlane proxy application for PerformanceVisor. It can be configured to map different measurement capilities from PerformanceVisor onto mPlane capabilities. The proxy turns PVSR into an mPlane repository and also into an mPlane probe, since it offers capabilities for the protocol verbs "query" and "measure".
